Code for modeling the impact of NPI implementations and lifting
in all US states.

The script dev_us.sh runs the initial simulation, using the actual outcome.

The script model_diff.sh estimates the outcome if all NPIs had been retained.

The script visualize_us.sh visualizes the results.

The script ./independent_R_estimates/estimate_R.sh is used to run the independent R estimates from EpiEstim, using a variable serial interval. The results are available here: https://covid19.bioinfo.se/Data/countries_regions.csv
